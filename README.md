			       		THE DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT:

			      		Advanced Computer Vision Project

Task : Develop a computer vision application for object detection or image segmentation.

Details:
- Data Collection: Gather and preprocess a dataset suitable for the task (e.g., labeled images for object detection).
- Model Selection: Implement state-of-the-art models like YOLO (You Only Look Once), Faster R-CNN, or U-Net for segmentation.
- Training and Evaluation: Train the model and evaluate its performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and Intersection over Union (IoU).

Deployment: 
- Integrate the model into an application or service.

Where to Do It:
- TensorFlow: Build and train computer vision models.
- PyTorch: Develop and experiment with advanced computer vision
